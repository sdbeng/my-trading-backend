## my backend

Here I designed two compelling WebSocket features I could implement, along with their benefits and monetization potential:

1. Real-Time Trading Signals & Alerts

Benefits:
Instant trade notifications without polling
Lower latency for time-sensitive decisions
Reduced server load compared to REST polling
Real-time market movement alerts

Monetization:
Tiered subscription model based on:
Number of symbols monitored
Signal frequency
Signal quality/confidence level
Premium features like custom alerts and advanced indicators

2. Collaborative Trading Dashboard
   next phase

## deployment steps

Deployment Steps:
SSH into your Hostinger VPS
Install Docker and Docker Compose
Set up Nginx as reverse proxy
Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt
Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Here's a basic Nginx configuration:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.yourdomain.com;

    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```
